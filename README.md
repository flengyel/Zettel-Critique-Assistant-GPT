# Zettel-Critique-Assistant-GPT

This tool is a GPT-based assistant designed to enhance Zettelkasten note-taking by ensuring adherence to three fundamental principles:
1. **Single Focus Principle**: Each Zettel should maintain a single thematic focus.
2. **WikiLinks Usage**: Use WikiLinks to indicate shifts in focus between Zettels.
3. **Future Self Orientation**: Write Zettels with the author's future self in mind, prioritizing clarity and utility over general consumption.

The assistant offers guidance on splitting multi-focused Zettels into individual, focused notes and creating structured outline notes from a collection of titles and descriptions.

## Purpose

This repository provides the operational instructions for the Zettel Critique Assistant GPT. 

## Usage
Access the GPT for use at: [Zettel Critique Assistant](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-z5XcnT7cQ-zettel-critique-assistant).

## Compatibility

The GPT is compatible with ChatGPT 4. I have yet to test it with ChatGPT 3.5.
