# Zettel-Critique-Assistant-GPT

GPT to critique your Zettels following three rules: Zettels should have a single focus, WikiLinks indicate a shift in focus, Zettels should be written for your future self. The GPT will suggest how to split multi-focused notes into separate notes. Create structure notes from multi-focused notes or a list of note titles and brief descriptions.
