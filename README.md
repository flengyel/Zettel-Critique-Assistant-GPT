# Zettel-Critique-Assistant-GPT

This tool is a GPT-based assistant designed to enhance Zettelkasten note-taking by ensuring adherence to three fundamental principles:
1. **Single Focus Principle**: Each Zettel should maintain a single thematic focus.
2. **WikiLinks Usage**: Use WikiLinks to indicate shifts in focus between Zettels.
3. **Future Self Orientation**: Write Zettels with the author's future self in mind, prioritizing clarity and utility over general consumption.

The assistant offers guidance on splitting multi-focused Zettels into individual, focused notes and on creating structured outline notes from a collection of titles and descriptions.
