# ZTEMP.1.0.24.0228 Zettel Template

 # Version: 2024.02.28.1

 # NOTE: the H1 header at the beginning of this file is present
 # to pass Markdown lint syntax checks. Remove the first line of
 # this file when using this template. The template begins with
 # the three dashes immediately above the version number.
 #
 # This self-documenting Zettel template specifies the format of 
 # a Zettel suitable for a digital Zettelkasten. The Zettel is
 # organized as a Markdown file, beginning with this YAML 
 # frontmatter followed by self-documenting Markdown sections 
 # in the order of presentation. The YAML frontmatter contains
 # commands to Zettlr, Pandoc, and Obsidian and includes, 
 # at minimum, the following variables: `title:` and 
 # `reference-section-title:` 

title: ZTEMP.1.0.24.0228 Zettel Template

 # The value of the `title:` variable is a quoted string, 
 # consisting of a unique, immutable ID, in this case 
 # `ZTEMP.1.0.24.0228`, followed by the Zettel title, in this case
 # "Zettel Template" Immutable, unique IDs may have 
 # different formats, according to personal preference. 
 # Timestamps are a popular choice, followed by Folgezettel. 

reference-section-title: References

 # The `reference-section-title:` variable is a command to Pandoc.
 # If Zettel is exported through Pandoc and the Zettel body includes 
 # Pandoc-style citations, the `reference-section-title:` variable 
 # will cause Pandoc to add a References section with citations to the
 # end of the exported document.

```

The Zettel body begins with an H1 header. In my system, the H1 header
duplicates the immutable, unique ID (`ZTEMP.1.0.24.0228`) and title
(`Zettel Template`) with the following syntax; however, this choice is
optional.

``` markdown
# ZTEMP.1.0.24.0228 Zettel Template
```

Titles aren't immutable, unlike IDs. The Zettel body ends immediately
before the **SEE ALSO** section below.

## Customization notes

*This section guides personalizing your Zettel template. Remember, these
elements can be adjusted to suit your note-taking preferences and
workflow. For example, while this template places the immutable ID to
the left of the title, some users might prefer it to the right.*

## Definitions

### Reference Element Types

-   **WikiLink**: A markdown link used within Zettels to interlink them
    within the Zettelkasten system. It is enclosed in double square
    brackets and typically includes a unique identifier followed by the
    title of the linked Zettel.

-   **Title-only WikiLink**: This format includes the WikiLink followed
    immediately by the title of the linked Zettel without additional
    annotations or explanations, adhering strictly to the format:
    `[[UniqueID]] Zettel Title`.

-   **Hashtags**: Hashtags are for thematic categorization and quick
    reference within your Zettelkasten. Hashtags typically occur in the
    SEE ALSO section of a Zettel.

-   **Pandoc citations**: Pandoc citations have the form `[@citeKey],`
    where `citeKey` is a citation Key for a citation maintained within a
    digital references management system such as Zotero or a manually
    created and maintained reference database.

### Types of Notes in Zettelkasten

1.  **Single-focus Zettels**: Focus on one main idea or topic for
    clarity and precision. Single-focus Zettels form the core of the
    Zettelkasten.

2.  **Structure Notes**: Outline and connect Single-focus Zettels under
    broader themes. They contain sections with annotated WikiLinks to
    individual Zettels.

3.  **Index Notes**: Serve as navigational tools within the
    Zettelkasten, marked by IDs starting with `0000.0000.0` and
    typically annotated with their title only.

## More on customization

*Enhance your Zettelkasten by tailoring this template to your needs. The
list of title-only WikiLinks in the SEE ALSO section is just a starting
point. Feel free to modify these links or hashtags to organize your
notes better.*

## Revised Zettel Construction Guidelines

1.  **ID and Title**:
    -   Start with a unique ID and clear title for each Zettel to ensure
        clarity and retrievability.
2.  **Main Body**:
    -   Prioritize writing Zettels with the author's future self in
        mind, emphasizing clarity and utility for the author rather than
        a general reader.
    -   **Single-focus Zettels**: Maintain a strict focus on one main
        idea or topic, crafting content for future clarity and utility.
        Annotate WikiLinks where they contribute to the topic's context,
        except for Index Note references. Links within the main body of
        a Single-focus Zettel should be directly related to the Zettel's
        central theme or idea and provide immediate, contextual support
        by offering additional information, evidence, or related
        viewpoints directly relevant to the Zettel's focus.
    -   **Structure Notes**: Organize and link related Single-focus
        Zettels under thematic sections, starting each section with a
        relevant annotated WikiLink.
    -   **Index Notes**: Used for navigation with a simple title
        annotation, listing relevant Single-focus or Structure Notes for
        easy access.
3.  **SEE ALSO Section**:
    -   The SEE ALSO section serves as a gateway for expanded
        exploration and understanding, offering the reader pathways to
        discover related concepts and themes that might not be central
        to Zettel's current focus but are valuable for a broader
        understanding or future research.
    -   The separation between the Main Body and the SEE ALSO section
        helps maintain the focus and clarity of the main content while
        still providing avenues for further exploration and connectivity
        within the Zettelkasten.
    -   The SEE ALSO section should contain title-only WikiLinks that
        are not directly tied to the central theme of the Zettel but are
        still relevant to the broader thematic landscape of the note,
        including:
        -   **Index Note WikiLinks**: Title-only WikiLinks to Index
            Notes that help with navigation and alphanumeric
            categorization but are not directly related to the Zettel's
            main content.
        -   **Distantly Related Zettel Links**: Title-only WikiLinks to
            Zettels that provide additional context and support for the
            ideas presented or suggest further research but are not
            essential to understanding the primary focus of the current
            Zettel.
        -   **Hashtags and Metadata**: The SEE ALSO can also include
            relevant hashtags and metadata that aid in organizing and
            retrieving Zettels within the Zettelkasten system.
4.  **References**:
    -   List external sources or additional reading materials to support
        content validity and facilitate further exploration.
